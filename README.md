# Feature Selection Methods for Boosted Crosspectral Face Recognition

  As a successful technology in commercial as well as surveillance applications, face recognition
has attracted significant attention. Wide range of applications using this technology has been
a constant motivation for research developments over the past decade. Major issues with
color images are illumination variation and pose change in which illumination variation has
been overcome by involving Short and Long Wave Infrared imagery. However, properties of
color images and Short and Long Wave Infrared images are different. Their crossmatching
presents a great challenge.

  In this thesis, we propose a methodology that will be able to crossmatch color face
images and Short Wave Infrared face images reliably and accurately. We first adopt a
recently designed Boosted Local Gabor Pattern Improved (LGPI) encoding and matching
technique to encode face images in both vsible and Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) spectral
bands. We then apply feature selection methods to prune irrelevant information in encoded
data and to improve performance of the Boosted LGPI technique. In this thesis, we propose
three novel feature selection methods: (1) Genuine segment score thresholding, (2) d0-based
thresholding and (3) two Adaboost inspired methods. We further compare the performance
of the original Boosted LGPI face recognition method with the method involving feature
selection step. Under a general parameter set up, a significant performance improvement is
observed and perfect verication performance is achieved.
